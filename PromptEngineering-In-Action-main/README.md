This is the code repository for [Prompt Engineering In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/prompt-engineering-in-action), published by Manning

# What is this book about?
Prompt Engineering in Action teaches you practical prompt engineering skills including:

This book covers the following topics:
  - Designing context-aware prompts tailored for specific tasks
  - Understanding and minimizing hallucinations
  - When to use prompt patterns such as Persona, Recipe, Template, and Game-Play
  - Utilizing templates to ensure consistent and reusable outputs
  - Integrating external knowledge bases with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Building and deploying practical LLM-based apps using LangChain

Prompt Engineering in Action presents patterns, templates, and techniques that help you get consistent, valuable responses from LLMs. You’ll learn how to design precise and context-aware prompts, discover metrics you can use to assess prompt quality, learn methods to scale and collaborate on prompts, and build advanced and agentic AI apps using LangChain.
